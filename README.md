# Web YouTube Downloader

## Introduction

- This is a web-based YouTube downloading website made for an iOS shortcut Downloadify

## Demonstration

- Here is the [link](https://loyahdev.me/youtubedl) for this repository demonstration.

## Reason

YouTube kind of made downloading videos way harder and current shortcuts are deemed not working. I made this using a downloading API for simplicity and a downloader that has no ads or sketchy websites.

## Thanks

Here are some repositories to accomplish this web-based service!
